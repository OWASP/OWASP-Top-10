Top_Ten
=======

Currently, the authoritative home of the OWASP Top Ten is the [OWASP wiki](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).

I hope that this can be a future home for the OWASP Top Ten, particularly around the derivitive products where the community can participate and contribute to the project. As an example, this woud be an ideal place for the community work together to create and contribute translations of OWASP Top Ten releases.

Cheers,

Dennis
